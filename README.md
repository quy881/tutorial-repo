#tutorial

My project was to follow the "Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners". 

Working on this tutorial was time consuming and frustrating. I ran into several issues and errors throughout.
The vidoes were relatively easy but I had to frequently pause and restart (especially those that autoplayed on their own)
to ensure I was correctly following directions. The nuisances and understanding require more than a tutorial. In addition,
I had to adjust make scripting to ensure I produced the same reulsts as the videos and/or text presented. Thus I spent
almost the same time scriptiong as I did searching the Internet for expalnations on what certain errors meant or explanation
As I progressed into the tutorial it became apparent the author(s) skipped steps and it felt more like a intermediate level
guide than beginner's. 

I've completed the scripting tutorial but I wasn't able to replicate the exact same results for the backup script in sections 13, 16 and 17.3.

I didn't utilize specific sources other than what google searches presented during error and concept checks.

I sent my repo link to my peer on 10/32020 at 4:55 pm

Code Review Shadice Greenup
- Reviewed code was coded correctly.
- for loop range can be coded as {1..3} instead of 1 2 3.
